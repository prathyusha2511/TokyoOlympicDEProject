# TokyoOlympicDEProject

For the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, I created a series of visualizations to provide key insights into athlete performance, country rankings, and event statistics. The dashboard includes a stacked bar chart Athlete Performance by Country and Discipline and Medal Distribution by Country, a side by side bar chart showing Gender Participation in events and a map displaying Number of Athletes from each country.Together, these visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the Olympic Games, illustrating athlete contributions, country rankings, and event-specific insights.
